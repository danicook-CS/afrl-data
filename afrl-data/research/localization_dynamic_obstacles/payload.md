## Summary
The robots should operate in real environments where the uncertainty is a huge problem. Moreover dynamic obstacles, can give a false perspective of the environment to the robot that it may lead to unexpected results. We provided a way of getting the robot localized, using particle filter and a "move to localize" technique that decreases the uncertainty.
